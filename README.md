# Gematria

A UTF-16 based implementation of a 13th century Hebrew practice to find coded messages
 within the text of the Bible.  The algorithm used matched words with other words of the 
 same numerical value.  Each letter of a word maps to a numerical value that sums up to a 
 word total linked to other words with the same total.  Words that share a common total are 
 concatenated with the belief that will reveal a hidden code.
